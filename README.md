# AndroidMemoryGame
A simple Android Memory Game, the game is you trying to match photos together while on a timer. Minecraft Themed

Made in Android Studio.
This is an old pet project of mine and it's pretty barebones. I decided to upload it as a reference incase any newcomer to Android was trying to make something similar. 

If you want to try the game, you can install MineCraftMemoryGameAPK.apk or build it in Android Studio in an emulator/your device.
